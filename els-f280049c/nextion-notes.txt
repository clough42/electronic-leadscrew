To compile the Nextion HMI file, you'll need the Nextion Editor. A precompiled 
Nextion TFT file is included. To load the TFT file to the display, copy the file
to a uSD card, insert into the Nextion display, power it on, and watch
the messages. Once firmware is loaded, remove card and power cycle everything.

The ELS code was built using Code Composer Studio 10.1.0 and C2000Ware 3.02.00.

The ELS code can be compiled in legacy COFF or to the new eabi (ELF) formats. 
However, until C2000Ware is fixed, references to F28x_usDelay may need to be 
changed to _F28x_usDelay. Places in C2000Ware that must be updated are 
f28004x_sysctrl.c and f28004x_examples.h. Here is the message about the problem.
First try without making any changes and if undefined references to F28x_usDelay
are seen, switch to COFF or make the changes.

BUT I only managed to get ELF files to work with RAM, not with FLASH. I only
managed to get COFF files to work with FLASH.
